Its meaning is &#8220;Hello, how are you?&#8221;.</li><li>Hesse people aren&#8217;t blue. This is a mixup. Instead there is a kind of Äppler  sold under the trademark &#8220;Blauer Bock&#8221; (this name would translate into &#8220;blue buck&#8221; ). Btw.  <a title=\"Wikipedia: Apfelwein\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apfelwein\">Äppler</a> is a wine made of apples – imagine cider, only tasty.</li><li> If someone is &#8220;blue&#8221; in Hesse (and the rest of Germany) it means he or she is drunk. This condition may also occur after a bit too much of Äppler.</li></ol><p>[yes, this is satirical]</p>",
